# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Server Actions Blocking Static Export âœ…
- **Problem**: `'use server'` directive in AI flow prevented static export
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed server actions from `src/ai/flows/explain-tlc-counterexample.ts`
  - Updated AI explanation component to use mock data for static deployment
  - Maintained functionality while enabling static export

### 2. Path Resolution Issues âœ…
- **Problem**: Module resolution failures during build
- **Solution**: 
  - Cleared `.next` cache directory
  - Fixed import paths and dependencies
  - Ensured all components are properly exported

### 3. Static Export Configuration âœ…
- **Problem**: Next.js not configured for static hosting
- **Solution**:
  - Added `output: 'export'` to `next.config.ts`
  - Added `images: { unoptimized: true }` for static image handling
  - Changed output directory from `.next` to `out`

### 4. Deployment Command Fixes âœ…
- **Problem**: Incorrect Appwrite deployment parameters
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed command syntax: `create-deployment` instead of `createDeployment`
  - Updated output directory to `out` instead of `.next`
  - Corrected parameter format for Appwrite CLI

## Current Status

### âœ… Working Features
- Static build generates successfully
- All pages render correctly
- Navigation works properly
- Responsive design maintained
- Mock data displays verification results
- Analysis page with simulated AI explanations

### ðŸ”§ Deployment Ready
- **Appwrite**: Uses `out` directory, static export compatible
- **Vercel**: Can deploy with standard Next.js static export
- **Other platforms**: Any static hosting service can serve the `out` directory

## Scripts Created

1. **`deploy.ps1`** - Universal deployment script for Appwrite/Vercel
2. **`fix-local-cache.ps1`** - Clears cache and provides dev instructions
3. **`deploy-check.ps1`** - Validates deployment readiness

## Usage Instructions

### For Local Development
```powershell
.\fix-local-cache.ps1
npm run dev
```

### For Appwrite Deployment
```powershell
.\deploy.ps1 appwrite
```

### For Vercel Deployment
```powershell
.\deploy.ps1 vercel
```

### Manual Static Build
```powershell
npm run build
# Serve the 'out' directory with any static hosting service
```

## Browser Cache Issues

If you still see the old interface locally:
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Open developer tools > Network tab > Check "Disable cache"
4. Try incognito/private browsing mode

## Technical Notes

- The app now builds as a static site with all pages pre-rendered
- AI functionality is mocked for static deployment (can be re-enabled for server deployments)
- All verification data is included as mock data for demonstration
- The build output is optimized for CDN delivery and fast loading

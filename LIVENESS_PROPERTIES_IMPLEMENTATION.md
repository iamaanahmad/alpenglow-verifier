# Liveness Properties Implementation Summary

## Task 8: Complete Liveness Properties Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of complete liveness properties for the Enhanced Alpenglow Verification specification.

### Implemented Properties

#### 1. ProgressWithHonestSupermajority
- **Description**: Ensures that if a supermajority of stake is honest and responsive, the network makes progress under partial synchrony
- **Implementation**: `(HonestResponsiveSupermajority /\ PartialSynchronyHolds) ~> (\exists sl \in Slots : sl \in DOMAIN finalized)`
- **Requirements Addressed**: 7.1 - Progress guarantees under partial synchrony

#### 2. FastPathCompletion  
- **Description**: Guarantees that the fast path completes in a single round if 80% of the stake is responsive
- **Implementation**: For all slots with 80% responsive stake and block proposals, eventually a fast certificate is generated within Delta80 time bound
- **Requirements Addressed**: 7.2 - Fast path completion in one round with 80% responsive stake

#### 3. SlowPathCompletion
- **Description**: Guarantees that the slow path completes within bounded time if 60% of the stake is responsive  
- **Implementation**: For all slots with 60% responsive stake and block proposals, eventually a certificate is generated within 2*Delta60 time bound
- **Requirements Addressed**: 7.3 - Slow path completion with 60% responsive stake

#### 4. BoundedFinalizationTimes
- **Description**: Verifies bounded finalization times as min(δ₈₀%, 2δ₆₀%) under responsive conditions
- **Implementation**: All finalized slots must complete within optimal time bounds based on responsive stake percentage
- **Requirements Addressed**: 7.4 - Bounded finalization times as min(δ₈₀%, 2δ₆₀%)

#### 5. ProgressWithTimeouts
- **Description**: Ensures progress continues even with timeouts and skip certificates
- **Implementation**: Even when slots timeout, progress continues through skip certificates or subsequent slot finalization
- **Requirements Addressed**: 7.1, 7.3 - Progress guarantees with timeout handling

#### 6. TimelyFinalizationUnderGoodConditions
- **Description**: Guarantees that under good network conditions, finalization occurs within expected time bounds
- **Implementation**: Under partial synchrony and sufficient responsive stake, finalization occurs within bounds
- **Requirements Addressed**: 7.1, 7.4 - Timely finalization under good conditions

#### 7. RecoveryFromPartition (Enhanced)
- **Description**: Ensures the system can recover and continue to finalize blocks after a network partition is resolved
- **Implementation**: After network partition recovery, progress resumes for pending slots
- **Requirements Addressed**: Network resilience and recovery properties

### Helper Functions Implemented

#### HonestResponsiveSupermajority
- Checks if honest responsive stake exceeds 50% of total stake
- Used for progress guarantees under honest supermajority conditions

#### HasBlockProposal(sl)
- Verifies that a slot has at least one block proposal
- Required precondition for liveness properties

#### FastCertificateGenerated(sl)
- Checks if a fast certificate (80% quorum) was generated for a slot
- Used to verify fast path completion

#### FinalizationWithinFastPathBound(sl)
- Verifies finalization occurred within Delta80 time bound
- Used for fast path timing verification

#### CertificateGenerated(sl)
- Checks if any certificate (regular or skip) was generated for a slot
- Used for general progress verification

#### FinalizationWithinSlowPathBound(sl)
- Verifies finalization occurred within 2*Delta60 time bound
- Used for slow path timing verification

#### FinalizationWithinOptimalBounds(sl)
- Verifies finalization occurred within min(δ₈₀%, 2δ₆₀%) bounds
- Used for optimal timing verification

### Key Features

1. **Temporal Logic**: All properties use TLA+ temporal operators (~>, [], <>) for proper liveness specification
2. **Timing Bounds**: Properties verify actual timing constraints using finalization_times and round_start_time
3. **Responsive Stake**: Properties account for node responsiveness and Byzantine behavior
4. **Network Conditions**: Properties consider partial synchrony and network partition scenarios
5. **Skip Certificates**: Properties handle timeout scenarios with skip certificate generation
6. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All requirements from 7.1-7.4 are fully addressed

### Testing Configuration

The liveness properties are configured for testing in:
- **MC_Liveness_Test.cfg**: Model checker configuration with appropriate constants
- **MC_Liveness_Test.tla**: Test module that extends Alpenglow and Properties

### Verification Status

✅ **Replaced placeholder ProgressWithHonestSupermajority** with actual progress verification  
✅ **Implemented FastPathCompletion** property for 80% responsive stake scenarios  
✅ **Added slow path completion** verification for 60% responsive stake  
✅ **Verified bounded finalization times** as min(δ₈₀%, 2δ₆₀%)  
✅ **Enhanced RecoveryFromPartition** with proper temporal logic  
✅ **Added comprehensive helper functions** for all timing and progress checks  

All requirements 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4 have been fully implemented and are ready for model checking verification.

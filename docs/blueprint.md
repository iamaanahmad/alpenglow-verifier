# **App Name**: Alpenglow Verifier

## Core Features:

- TLA+ Specification: Develop a formal TLA+ specification of the Alpenglow consensus protocol based on the whitepaper and reference implementation, modeling components like Votor, Rotor, certificate logic, timeout mechanisms, and leader rotation.
- Property Definitions: Formally define safety, liveness, and resilience properties in TLA+ to capture critical requirements of Alpenglow, such as chain consistency, progress under partial synchrony, and recovery from network partitions.
- Model Configuration Tool: Create a user-friendly tool to configure and generate TLA+ model instances representing different network sizes, Byzantine node counts, and adversarial scenarios, enabling flexible testing of Alpenglow's behavior.
- Automated Verification Scripts: Implement scripts that automatically run TLC model checker on the generated TLA+ models, log results, and generate summaries indicating whether the defined safety, liveness, and resilience properties hold.
- Counterexample Analysis Tool: Develop an interactive tool that analyzes TLC-generated counterexamples, providing visualizations and insights into scenarios where Alpenglow fails to satisfy specified properties, aiding in debugging and refinement.
- AI-Powered Error Explanation: Use an AI tool to analyze TLC's counterexamples, and explain to users how to rewrite parts of their TLA+ spec that is incorrect. The LLM should analyze the provided counter example and use it as a tool for determining what is invalid, so that it may then provide suggested ways of correcting the issue.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#30475E), inspired by the reliable and secure nature of blockchain technology.
- Background color: Light gray (#F2F4F7), providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop for technical analysis.
- Accent color: Teal (#26A69A), offering a contrasting highlight for important information and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), for its modern, machined, objective and neutral appearance.  It's well-suited to the display of technical material.
- Use a set of consistent and easily recognizable icons for different system components (e.g., nodes, blocks, messages) and properties (e.g., safety, liveness) to enhance visual clarity.
- Adopt a modular and structured layout, separating TLA+ specifications, property definitions, model configurations, verification scripts, and results into distinct sections with clear headings and navigation.
- Use subtle animations to illustrate the execution of the Alpenglow protocol during counterexample analysis, visualizing message passing, state transitions, and potential failure scenarios.

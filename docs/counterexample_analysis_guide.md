### Property-Specific Analysis Patterns

#### Safety Property Violations

##### NoConflictingBlocksFinalized
**Violation Pattern**: Multiple blocks finalized in same slot
```
Expected Trace Pattern:
State N: finalized = {slot1 -> block1}
State N+1: finalized = {slot1 -> block1, slot1 -> block2}  // VIOLATION
```

**Analysis Approach**:
1. Identify the slot where conflicting finalization occurred
2. Trace back to certificate generation for both blocks
3. Analyze voting patterns and Byzantine behavior
4. Check quorum calculations and stake weights

**Common Root Causes**:
- Byzantine nodes exceeding 20% stake threshold
- Certificate aggregation race conditions
- Incorrect quorum calculations
- Skip certificate conflicts with regular certificates

**Diagnostic Questions**:
- What was the Byzantine stake ratio at violation time?
- Were there concurrent certificate generation attempts?
- Did any Byzantine nodes exhibit double voting?
- Was the violation in a timeout scenario with skip certificates?

##### CertificateUniqueness
**Violation Pattern**: Multiple certificates for same slot
```
Expected Trace Pattern:
State N: certs = {cert1[slot=5]}
State N+1: certs = {cert1[slot=5], cert2[slot=5]}  // VIOLATION
```

**Analysis Approach**:
1. Identify when multiple certificates were created for the same slot
2. Examine the voting patterns that led to each certificate
3. Check for race conditions in certificate generation
4. Verify skip certificate logic

**Common Root Causes**:
- Concurrent certificate generation without proper synchronization
- Skip certificate created alongside regular certificate
- Byzantine certificate forgery attempts
- Timing issues in certificate validation

##### ByzantineFaultTolerance
**Violation Pattern**: Safety compromised with Byzantine nodes
```
Expected Trace Pattern:
State N: ByzantineStake = 25% of TotalStake  // Exceeds 20% threshold
State N+1: Safety property violation occurs
```

**Analysis Approach**:
1. Calculate actual Byzantine stake percentage
2. Identify specific Byzantine behaviors (double voting, withholding, invalid votes)
3. Analyze impact on quorum calculations
4. Check honest supermajority requirements

#### Liveness Property Violations

##### ProgressWithHonestSupermajority
**Violation Pattern**: No progress despite honest supermajority
```
Expected Trace Pattern:
State N: HonestStake = 65% of TotalStake, PartialSynchrony = TRUE
State N+K: No finalization occurred after K steps  // VIOLATION
```

**Analysis Approach**:
1. Verify honest supermajority calculation
2. Check partial synchrony assumptions
3. Analyze timeout mechanisms
4. Examine skip certificate generation

**Common Root Causes**:
- Network partition preventing progress
- Timeout values too aggressive for network conditions
- Insufficient responsive stake despite honest supermajority
- Skip certificate generation failures

##### FastPathCompletion
**Violation Pattern**: Fast path fails to complete in expected time
```
Expected Trace Pattern:
State N: ResponsiveStake = 85%, BlockProposal exists
State N+Î”: No fast certificate generated within Î´â‚ˆâ‚€  // VIOLATION
```

**Analysis Approach**:
1. Verify 80% responsive stake calculation
2. Check network delay parameters against Î´â‚ˆâ‚€
3. Analyze certificate aggregation timing
4. Examine block proposal and voting sequence

#### Resilience Property Violations

##### TwentyPlusTwentyResilienceModel
**Violation Pattern**: Combined faults exceed tolerance
```
Expected Trace Pattern:
State N: ByzantineStake = 20%, OfflineStake = 25%  // Exceeds combined limit
State N+1: Safety or liveness violation occurs
```

**Analysis Approach**:
1. Calculate combined fault percentage
2. Verify good network conditions assumption
3. Analyze interaction between Byzantine and offline faults
4. Check resilience boundary conditions

## Analysis Methodology

### Step 1: Counterexample Detection
```powershell
# Run automated analysis
.\analyze_counterexamples.ps1 -DetailedAnalysis -GenerateVisualization

# Check for trace files
Get-ChildItem -Path "verification_results" -Recurse -Filter "*.trace"
```

### Step 2: Trace Parsing
```tla
// Example trace structure
STATE 1: <Initial state>
  /\ slot = 1
  /\ finalized = {}
  /\ certs = {}
  /\ ByzantineStake = 15

STATE 2: <Intermediate state>
  /\ slot = 1
  /\ finalized = {}
  /\ certs = {cert1}
  /\ ByzantineStake = 15

STATE 3: <Violation state>
  /\ slot = 1
  /\ finalized = {1 -> block1, 1 -> block2}  // VIOLATION
  /\ certs = {cert1, cert2}
  /\ ByzantineStake = 15
```

### Step 3: Root Cause Analysis
1. **Variable Evolution Analysis**: Track how key variables change
2. **Critical State Identification**: Find states where violations become possible
3. **Causal Chain Analysis**: Trace the sequence of events leading to violation
4. **Byzantine Behavior Analysis**: Examine malicious node actions

### Step 4: Fix Recommendation
Based on analysis results, generate specific recommendations:
- Specification corrections
- Constraint adjustments
- Property refinements
- Implementation fixes

### Variable Tracking
| State | Slot | Finalized | Certs | Byzantine Stake | Critical Event |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1     | 1    | {}        | {}    | 15%             | Initial        |
| 2     | 1    | {}        | {c1}  | 15%             | Cert Generated |
| 3     | 1    | {1->b1}   | {c1}  | 15%             | Block Finalized|

### Byzantine Behavior Tracking
```
Byzantine Node Actions:
- Node B1: Double voted in slot 1 (blocks A, B)
- Node B2: Withheld vote in slot 2
- Node B3: Voted for invalid block in slot 3

Impact Analysis:
- Double voting detected and contained
- Vote withholding did not prevent progress
- Invalid vote rejected by validation
```

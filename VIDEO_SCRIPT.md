## Script with Timings (Easy Words)

### PART 1: Introduction (0:00 - 1:00)

**[SHOW: Open VS Code, show README.md file with green badges at top]**

**What to Say:**
*"Hello everyone! I'm showing you the formal verification of Alpenglow - this is Solana's new consensus protocol that makes blocks finalize very fast, in just 100-150 milliseconds."*

**[SHOW: Scroll down to show the green badges showing tests passing]**

*"See these green badges here? All our 7 tests are passing - that means 100% success rate. We have tested 12 different properties - safety properties, liveness properties, Byzantine attack scenarios, network partition recovery, and timing bounds. Everything is working perfectly. Now let me show you how we did this testing."*

---

### PART 2: Running the Tests (1:00 - 3:00)

**[SHOW: Open PowerShell terminal, show the project folder]**

**What to Say:**
*"Now I will run all our tests live in front of you. Let me type this command..."*

**[TYPE IN TERMINAL:]**
```powershell
cd C:\Projects\alpenglow-verifier
.\run_complete_verification.ps1 -Workers 4
```

**[SHOW: Script starts running, tests are executing one by one]**

*"See, it's running now. This script runs 7 different tests:*

*First test - MC_4Nodes_Working - this tests basic safety with 4 nodes. Very quick.*

*Second test - MC_7Nodes_Working - now we test with 7 nodes, checks many scenarios. This will take around 90 seconds.*

*Third test - MC_10Nodes_Working - testing with 10 nodes, making sure everything scales up properly. Takes around 2 minutes.*

*Fourth test - MC_4Nodes_Byzantine - this is important! Here one node is Byzantine, means it's a bad actor trying to attack. It controls 25% stake. We test if the system can handle this attack.*

*Fifth test - MC_4Nodes_Liveness - this checks temporal properties, means checking if the system keeps making progress and doesn't get stuck.*

*Sixth test - MC_4Nodes_Partition - NEW! This tests what happens when network splits into two parts, then comes back together. Does the system recover? Yes it does!*

*Seventh test - MC_4Nodes_Timing - ALSO NEW! This verifies the timing bounds from the whitepaper - the min(δ₈₀%, 2δ₆₀%) claim."*

**[SHOW: Tests completing, green checkmarks appearing]**

*"Perfect! See? All 7 tests PASSED! 100% success rate. No errors found. Everything is working correctly."*

---

### PART 3: Showing the Specification (3:00 - 5:00)

**[SHOW: Open Alpenglow.tla file in VS Code]**

**What to Say:**
*"Now let me show you the actual specification - the TLA+ code. This file Alpenglow.tla has almost 2,000 lines of code. This is not just simple pseudocode - this is complete mathematical model of the entire Alpenglow protocol."*

**[SHOW: Scroll through the file slowly, showing different sections]**

*"See here? We have modelled everything - Votor's voting system with two paths (fast 80% path and slower 60% path), Rotor's block propagation using erasure coding, certificate creation, timeout handling, skip certificates, and also Byzantine behaviors like double voting and equivocation - means when a bad node tries to cheat."*

**[SHOW: Scroll down to find property definitions around line 320-360]**

**What to Say:**
*"Now let me show you the most important property - NoConflictingBlocksFinalized. This line here checks that two different blocks can never be finalized in the same slot. This is the main safety guarantee - no blockchain forks can happen."*

**[SHOW: Point to the property definition]**

*"The way it works is - it checks all finalized blocks, and if two slots are same number, then the blocks inside them must also be exactly same. Simple logic, but very powerful guarantee."*

**[SHOW: Scroll down a bit more to show CertificateUniqueness]**

*"Second important property - CertificateUniqueness. This ensures only one valid certificate per slot. Why? Because certificates need votes from validators having at least 60% stake. And honest validators vote only once per slot. So maximum one certificate can be valid. This maintains integrity."*

*"Our TLA+ model checker tests all possible scenarios - different orderings of votes, blocks, network delays, Byzantine attacks - and confirms these properties hold in every single case."*

---

### PART 4: Byzantine Attack Testing (5:00 - 7:00)

**[SHOW: Open MC_4Nodes_Byzantine.cfg file]**

**What to Say:**
*"Now let me show you the Byzantine testing - this is where we test attacks. See this configuration file? Here node n4 is marked as Byzantine. That means it's a bad actor controlling 25% of total stake."*

**[SHOW: Point to ByzantineNodes = {n4} and ByzantineStakeRatio = 25]**

*"In our TLA+ model, this Byzantine node can do three types of attacks:*

*First - double voting. Means voting for two different blocks in the same slot.*

*Second - equivocation. Means sending different blocks to different validators to confuse them.*

*Third - withholding votes. Means purposely not voting to delay the system."*

**[SHOW: Go back to terminal or show DAY_3_COMPLETE_REPORT.md results]**

*"But see the results? Even with these attacks, all tests passed! The Byzantine test ran for 99 seconds and checked around 80,000+ states. Zero violations found! This proves the protocol can handle up to 25% malicious stake, exactly as the whitepaper claims."*

**[SHOW: Open MC_4Nodes_Partition.cfg]**

**What to Say:**
*"Now something unique - network partition testing. This test checks what happens when network splits. Imagine 2 nodes on one side, 2 nodes on other side. Can they still work? What happens when network rejoins?"*

**[SHOW: Scroll in file to show the constants]**

*"Our test simulates 2+2 partition and 3+1 partition scenarios. The results show - minority partition doesn't finalize blocks (safe!), majority partition keeps working (liveness!), and when partition heals, everything synchronizes back (recovery!). All working perfectly!"*

---

### PART 5: Timing & Liveness Properties (7:00 - 8:30)

**[SHOW: Open MC_4Nodes_Timing.cfg]**

**What to Say:**
*"Now let me show you the timing verification - this is NEW feature we added. The Alpenglow whitepaper claims finalization happens in min(δ₈₀%, 2δ₆₀%) time. We verified this!"*

**[SHOW: Point to Delta80 = 1 and Delta60 = 2 in config]**

*"See these parameters? Delta80 equals 1, Delta60 equals 2. This models the fast path (1 round with 80% stake) and slow path (2 rounds with 60% stake). Our test confirms the system respects these timing bounds."*

**[SHOW: Open MC_4Nodes_Liveness.cfg]**

*"For liveness testing, we check two critical things:"*

**[SHOW: Scroll to PROPERTIES section in the file]**

*"First property - ProgressWithHonestSupermajority. This proves that with honest majority, system keeps making progress. It never gets stuck. Blocks keep getting finalized.*

*Second property - FastPathCompletion. This confirms that when 80% stake is responsive, fast path works and completes quickly.*

*Both these temporal properties passed testing! This means the system is live - it keeps working, keeps making progress, never hangs."*

---

### PART 6: What Makes This Special (8:30 - 9:30)

**[SHOW: Open DAY_3_COMPLETE_REPORT.md and scroll to competitive analysis section]**

**What to Say:**
*"Now let me tell you what makes this submission special and different from others."*

**[SHOW: Point to the comparison table]**

*"See this comparison? Typical competitor has 3-5 properties tested. We have 12 properties - that's 2 to 4 times more!*

*Typical competitor has 2-3 test configurations. We have 7 configurations - that's 2 to 3 times more!*

*Most competitors don't have explicit partition testing. We have it - MC_4Nodes_Partition - very unique!*

*Most competitors don't have timing verification. We have it - MC_4Nodes_Timing - also unique!*

*And most importantly - typical success rate is 60-80%. Our success rate? 100%! All 7 tests passing! Zero errors!"*

**[SHOW: Open README.md]**

*"Our specification is almost 2,000 lines of TLA+ code. Most competitors have 300-500 lines. We have complete Byzantine testing with 25% adversarial stake. We have explicit network partition recovery. We have timing bounds verification. And everything is properly documented with progress reports."*

---

### PART 7: Conclusion (9:30 - 10:00)

**[SHOW: Go back to terminal showing the test summary with all green checkmarks]**

**What to Say:**
*"So let me summarize everything:*

*Number one - We have 100% test success rate. All 7 tests passing. No errors.*

*Number two - We verified 12 important properties. Safety properties like NoConflictingBlocksFinalized and CertificateUniqueness. Liveness properties like ProgressWithHonestSupermajority. Byzantine resilience. Network partition recovery. Timing bounds.*

## Recording Tips (in Simple Words)

### What You Need:
- **Screen Recorder**: Use OBS Studio (it's free) or Windows Game Bar (press Win+G)
- **Microphone**: Your laptop mic is fine, just speak clearly
- **Video Editor**: Use Windows Video Editor (comes with Windows) or DaVinci Resolve (free)

### Before Recording - Important Steps:
1. **Make text bigger** - In VS Code press Ctrl and + together many times. In PowerShell also increase font size. Text should be very easy to read.
2. **Clean your desktop** - Close all extra windows, browser tabs, anything not needed.
3. **Turn off notifications** - Very important! Go to Windows Focus Assist and turn ON. No WhatsApp, no email notifications during recording.
4. **Test your voice** - Record 10 seconds, play it back. Voice should be clear and loud enough.
5. **Practice once** - Read through the script one time before actual recording.

### How to Record:
1. **Prepare everything first:**
   - Open all files in VS Code tabs (Alpenglow.tla, MC_4Nodes_Byzantine.cfg, MC_4Nodes_Liveness.cfg, README.md, DAY_3_COMPLETE_REPORT.md)
   - Open PowerShell in alpenglow-verifier folder
   - Keep the script open on phone or second monitor

2. **Start recording:**
   - Press Win+G (Windows Game Bar) or open OBS Studio
   - Click Start Recording
   - Take 2-3 seconds pause (makes editing easier)

3. **Record in parts:**
   - Don't try to do everything in one shot
   - Record Part 1, stop
   - Record Part 2, stop
   - Like this do all 7 parts
   - If you make mistake, just stop and record that part again

4. **Speak naturally:**
   - Don't rush, speak at normal speed
   - Imagine you're explaining to a friend
   - It's okay to pause and think
   - Use simple words, same as we wrote in script

5. **Show clearly:**
   - When scrolling, go slow
   - When pointing to code, move cursor there
   - Give time for viewers to read

### After Recording:
1. **Edit videos together:**
   - Use Windows Video Editor (free, simple)
   - Drag all 7 parts into timeline
   - Cut out mistakes or pauses that are too long
   - Add title at start: "Alpenglow TLA+ Verification"
   - Add end screen with GitHub link

2. **Export video:**
   - Export as MP4

## Don't Worry Points 😊

- **If you make mistakes while recording**: It's okay! Just stop and record that part again. No one will know. That's why we edit.

- **If English is not perfect**: Don't worry at all! Judges care about technical content, not accent. Speak clearly in your natural voice.

- **If video takes longer than 10 minutes**: No problem! Even 11-12 minutes is fine. Just don't make it too long (15+ minutes).

- **If you feel nervous**: Remember - your project is EXCELLENT! You have 7 passing tests, 12 properties, comprehensive testing. You're just showing what already works. Be confident!

---

## Pro Tips (Bonus)

1. **Smile while speaking** - Even though camera is not on you, smiling makes your voice sound friendlier and more confident.

2. **Drink water before recording** - Keeps voice clear.

3. **Best time to record** - Morning or evening when house is quiet.

4. **If stuck** - Watch 2-3 other TLA+ videos on YouTube first to get idea of style.

5. **Remember** - You don't need to be perfect! You just need to show your excellent work. Your project speaks for itself.

# Bounty Requirements Compliance

## Executive Summary

This document demonstrates how the Alpenglow formal verification project addresses the requirements of the Superteam Earn bounty for formal verification of Solana's Alpenglow consensus protocol.

**Test Status**: 7/7 tests passing (100% success rate)

### Coverage
- ✅ Votor voting mechanism (fast 80% and slow 60% paths)
- ✅ Rotor block propagation with erasure coding
- ✅ Certificate generation and aggregation
- ✅ Timeout handling and skip certificates
- ✅ Byzantine behaviors (double voting, equivocation)
- ✅ Network conditions (delays, partitions)
- ✅ Window-based progression

**Evidence**: Alpenglow.tla, Properties.tla in repository

---

## Requirement 2: Machine-Verified Properties

1. **NoConflictingBlocksFinalized** - No two different blocks finalized in same slot
2. **CertificateUniqueness** - At most one valid certificate per slot
3. **SlotBounds** - Slot progression stays within bounds
4. **ValidByzantineStake** - Byzantine stake constraints maintained
5. **BlockPropagationCorrectness** - Rotor integrity verified
6. **CertificateAggregationCorrectness** - Vote aggregation accurate

### Liveness Properties Verified
7. **ProgressWithHonestSupermajority** - System makes progress with >60% honest stake
8. **FastPathCompletion** - Fast path operates correctly with 80% quorum
9. **PartitionRecoveryLiveness** - Progress resumes after partition heals
10. **CrashFaultTolerance** - System tolerates node failures

### Resilience Properties Verified
11. **Byzantine Tolerance** - Safety maintained with up to 25% adversarial stake
12. **Network Partition Recovery** - System recovers from network splits

**Evidence**: Properties defined in Properties.tla and verified via test configurations

---

## Requirement 3: Model Checking & Testing

### Test Configurations (7 total)

**Multi-Node Safety Verification:**
- `MC_4Nodes_Working.cfg/.tla` - 4-node safety verification
- `MC_7Nodes_Working.cfg/.tla` - 7-node safety verification  
- `MC_10Nodes_Working.cfg/.tla` - 10-node scalability testing

**Byzantine Resilience:**
- `MC_4Nodes_Byzantine.cfg/.tla` - Byzantine attack simulation (25% adversarial stake)

**Liveness Verification:**
- `MC_4Nodes_Liveness.cfg/.tla` - Temporal property verification

**Network Resilience:**
- `MC_4Nodes_Partition.cfg/.tla` - Partition recovery scenarios (2+2 and 3+1 splits)
- `MC_4Nodes_Timing.cfg/.tla` - Timing bound verification

### Test Results

Run `.\run_complete_verification.ps1 -Workers 4` to verify:

```
Test: MC_4Nodes_Working          ✅ PASS (Safety - 4 nodes)
Test: MC_7Nodes_Working          ✅ PASS (Safety - 7 nodes)
Test: MC_10Nodes_Working         ✅ PASS (Scalability - 10 nodes)
Test: MC_4Nodes_Byzantine        ✅ PASS (Byzantine - 25% stake)
Test: MC_4Nodes_Liveness         ✅ PASS (Liveness - Temporal properties)
Test: MC_4Nodes_Partition        ✅ PASS (Partition - Network recovery)
Test: MC_4Nodes_Timing           ✅ PASS (Timing - Bounded finalization)

✓ ALL TESTS PASSED
  Success Rate: 100%
  Violations Found: 0
```

**Evidence**: `run_complete_verification.ps1`, test configuration files, execution logs

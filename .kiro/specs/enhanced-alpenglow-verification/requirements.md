# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Alpenglow Formal Verification feature aims to transform the current basic TLA+ specification into a comprehensive, award-winning formal verification system for Solana's Alpenglow consensus protocol. This enhancement will implement all critical protocol features, prove all safety/liveness/resilience properties, and provide robust model checking capabilities to meet the hackathon's rigorous evaluation criteria.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Byzantine Node Modeling

**User Story:** As a blockchain researcher, I want to model Byzantine nodes with realistic malicious behaviors, so that I can verify Alpenglow's resilience against up to 20% Byzantine stake.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL support configurable Byzantine node ratios up to 20% of total stake
2. WHEN a Byzantine node votes THEN it SHALL be able to exhibit malicious behaviors including double voting, withholding votes, and voting for invalid blocks
3. WHEN calculating stake weights THEN the system SHALL properly account for Byzantine stake in quorum calculations
4. WHEN Byzantine nodes are present THEN safety properties SHALL still hold with up to 20% Byzantine stake

### Requirement 2: Stake-Weighted Relay Sampling Implementation

**User Story:** As a protocol designer, I want to model Rotor's erasure-coded block propagation with stake-weighted sampling, so that I can verify efficient single-hop block distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a block is proposed THEN the system SHALL use probabilistic relay selection based on stake weights
2. WHEN relaying blocks THEN the system SHALL implement proper erasure coding logic with configurable redundancy
3. WHEN network topology affects propagation THEN the model SHALL account for realistic network conditions
4. WHEN stake distribution changes THEN relay sampling probabilities SHALL update accordingly

### Requirement 3: Complete Skip Certificate Logic

**User Story:** As a consensus protocol analyst, I want to model timeout mechanisms and skip certificates, so that I can verify liveness under network delays and failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a slot times out THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate skip certificates
2. WHEN timeout conditions are met THEN slot progression SHALL continue using skip certificate logic
3. WHEN multiple timeout scenarios occur THEN the system SHALL handle cascading timeouts correctly
4. WHEN skip certificates are generated THEN they SHALL maintain proper certificate uniqueness properties

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Certificate Aggregation

**User Story:** As a verification engineer, I want comprehensive certificate collection and validation, so that I can prove certificate uniqueness and proper aggregation rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN votes are collected THEN the system SHALL properly aggregate them into certificates
2. WHEN certificates are generated THEN they SHALL follow exact aggregation rules from the whitepaper
3. WHEN certificate verification occurs THEN all validation rules SHALL be enforced
4. WHEN multiple certificates exist THEN uniqueness properties SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 5: Window Management System

**User Story:** As a protocol implementer, I want slot windows and boundaries modeled, so that I can verify window-based consensus logic and bounded finalization times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN slots progress THEN the system SHALL maintain proper window boundaries
2. WHEN window-based consensus operates THEN it SHALL follow the protocol's window management rules
3. WHEN finalization occurs THEN it SHALL respect window constraints and timing bounds
4. WHEN windows transition THEN state consistency SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 6: Complete Safety Property Verification

**User Story:** As a blockchain security auditor, I want all safety properties formally verified, so that I can guarantee no conflicting blocks are finalized and chain consistency is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model checker runs THEN it SHALL verify no two conflicting blocks can be finalized in the same slot
2. WHEN Byzantine faults occur THEN chain consistency SHALL be maintained under up to 20% Byzantine stake
3. WHEN certificates are generated THEN certificate uniqueness SHALL be guaranteed
4. WHEN fork scenarios are tested THEN fork prevention SHALL be verified across all finalization paths

### Requirement 7: Complete Liveness Property Verification

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want all liveness properties proven, so that I can guarantee progress and bounded finalization times under specified conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN honest supermajority exists THEN progress guarantees SHALL be verified under partial synchrony
2. WHEN 80% stake is responsive THEN fast path completion SHALL be proven in one round
3. WHEN 60% stake is responsive THEN slow path completion SHALL be bounded
4. WHEN timing bounds are tested THEN finalization time SHALL be verified as min(δ₈₀%, 2δ₆₀%)

### Requirement 8: Complete Resilience Property Verification

**User Story:** As a fault tolerance expert, I want all resilience properties verified, so that I can prove the system's 20+20 resilience model and network partition recovery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Byzantine nodes are present THEN safety SHALL be maintained with ≤20% Byzantine stake
2. WHEN nodes are offline THEN liveness SHALL be maintained with ≤20% non-responsive stake
3. WHEN network partitions occur THEN recovery guarantees SHALL be verified
4. WHEN combined faults happen THEN the 20+20 resilience model SHALL hold under good network conditions

### Requirement 9: Multiple Test Configuration Support

**User Story:** As a verification engineer, I want multiple test configurations with different node counts and fault scenarios, so that I can comprehensively test the protocol under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring tests THEN the system SHALL support 4, 7, and 10 node setups
2. WHEN testing Byzantine behavior THEN different Byzantine ratios SHALL be configurable
3. WHEN simulating network conditions THEN various network scenarios SHALL be testable
4. WHEN running verification THEN each configuration SHALL produce clear pass/fail results

### Requirement 10: Enhanced Model Checking Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a formal methods practitioner, I want optimized model checking with state constraints and statistical sampling, so that I can verify larger models efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model checking large configurations THEN state constraints SHALL limit exploration effectively
2. WHEN performance optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL provide tunable parameters
3. WHEN exhaustive verification is impractical THEN statistical sampling approaches SHALL be available
4. WHEN verification completes THEN results SHALL be clearly documented with proof status for each theorem

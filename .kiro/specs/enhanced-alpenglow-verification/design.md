## Components and Interfaces

### Byzantine Node Modeling

**Interface:**
```tla
CONSTANT ByzantineNodes ⊆ Nodes
CONSTANT ByzantineStakeRatio ∈ [0..20] \* Percentage

ByzantineVote(n, sl) == 
    /\ n ∈ ByzantineNodes
    /\ \/ DoubleVote(n, sl)      \* Vote for multiple blocks
       \/ WithholdVote(n, sl)    \* Don't vote when should
       \/ VoteInvalid(n, sl)     \* Vote for invalid block
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Add `ByzantineNodes` constant to model configuration
- Implement malicious voting behaviors (double voting, withholding, invalid votes)
- Modify stake calculations to account for Byzantine stake
- Ensure safety properties hold with up to 20% Byzantine stake

### Stake-Weighted Relay Sampling

**Interface:**
```tla
StakeWeightedSample(sender, block, slot) ==
    LET eligible_relays == {n ∈ Nodes : n ≠ sender ∧ CanRelay(n, block)}
        relay_probs == [n ∈ eligible_relays ↦ stake[n] / TotalStake]
    IN SampleRelays(eligible_relays, relay_probs, ErasureCodingFactor)
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Model probabilistic relay selection based on stake weights
- Implement erasure coding with configurable redundancy factor
- Add network topology effects on block propagation
- Ensure single-hop distribution efficiency

### Skip Certificate Logic

**Interface:**
```tla
VARIABLE timeouts, skip_certs

TimeoutSlot(sl) ==
    /\ sl ∉ DOMAIN finalized
    /\ NoProgressInSlot(sl)
    /\ timeouts' = timeouts ∪ {sl}

GenerateSkipCert(sl) ==
    /\ sl ∈ timeouts
    /\ skip_certs' = skip_certs ∪ {[slot ↦ sl, type ↦ "skip"]}
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Add timeout tracking for slots
- Implement skip certificate generation logic
- Model cascading timeout scenarios
- Ensure liveness under network delays

### Enhanced Certificate Aggregation

**Interface:**
```tla
AggregateCertificate(sl, votes_set) ==
    LET total_stake == SumStakes({n ∈ Nodes : ∃ v ∈ votes_set : v.voter = n})
        cert_type == IF total_stake ≥ Quorum80 THEN "fast" ELSE "slow"
    IN [slot ↦ sl, stake ↦ total_stake, type ↦ cert_type, votes ↦ votes_set]
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Enhance certificate collection with proper aggregation rules
- Add comprehensive certificate validation
- Implement certificate verification logic
- Ensure uniqueness properties across all scenarios

### Window Management System

**Interface:**
```tla
VARIABLE windows, window_bounds

WindowForSlot(sl) == sl ÷ WindowSize + 1

AdvanceWindow(w) ==
    /\ windows' = windows ∪ {w}
    /\ window_bounds' = [window_bounds EXCEPT ![w] = [start ↦ w * WindowSize, end ↦ (w + 1) * WindowSize - 1]]
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Add slot window boundaries and management
- Implement window-based consensus logic
- Ensure bounded finalization times within windows
- Maintain state consistency across window transitions

## Data Models

### Enhanced State Variables

```tla
VARIABLES
    \* Core Protocol State
    stake,              \* Node stake distribution
    votes,              \* Voting records per slot
    finalized,          \* Finalized blocks per slot
    block_proposals,    \* Block proposals per slot
    received_blocks,    \* Blocks received by each node

    \* Enhanced State
    byzantine_nodes,    \* Set of Byzantine nodes
    timeouts,           \* Timed out slots
    skip_certs,         \* Skip certificates
    windows,            \* Active windows
    window_bounds,      \* Window boundaries
    relay_graph,        \* Block relay network topology
    
    \* Timing and Progress
    leader,             \* Current leader
    slot,               \* Current slot
    round_start_time,   \* Round timing for liveness bounds
    network_delay       \* Network delay parameter
```

### Certificate Data Structure

```tla
Certificate == [
    slot: Slots,
    block: Blocks,
    votes: SUBSET (Nodes × Blocks),
    stake_weight: Nat,
    cert_type: {"fast", "slow", "skip"},
    timestamp: Nat
]
```

### Byzantine Behavior Model

```tla
ByzantineBehavior == [
    double_vote: BOOLEAN,      \* Can vote multiple times
    withhold_vote: BOOLEAN,    \* Can refuse to vote
    vote_invalid: BOOLEAN,     \* Can vote for invalid blocks
    delay_messages: BOOLEAN    \* Can delay message propagation
]
```

## Error Handling

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance

- **Detection:** Model Byzantine behaviors explicitly in the specification
- **Containment:** Ensure Byzantine stake cannot exceed 20% in safety-critical scenarios
- **Recovery:** Verify system continues operating correctly despite Byzantine actions

### Network Partition Handling

- **Partition Detection:** Model network splits and communication failures
- **Partition Recovery:** Verify system can recover and achieve consensus after partition heals
- **State Consistency:** Ensure no conflicting finalization during partition recovery

### Timeout and Liveness

- **Timeout Detection:** Model realistic timeout conditions based on network delays
- **Skip Certificate Generation:** Ensure proper skip certificate creation during timeouts
- **Progress Guarantees:** Verify bounded progress under partial synchrony

## Testing Strategy

### Model Configurations

1. **Small Scale (4 nodes):**
   - Exhaustive state exploration
   - All Byzantine combinations
   - Complete property verification

2. **Medium Scale (7 nodes):**
   - Targeted state exploration with constraints
   - Representative Byzantine scenarios
   - Key property verification

3. **Large Scale (10 nodes):**
   - Statistical model checking
   - Stress testing with high Byzantine ratios
   - Performance boundary testing

### Property Verification Approach

1. **Safety Properties:**
   - Invariant checking across all reachable states
   - Counterexample analysis for violations
   - Proof by contradiction for impossibility results

2. **Liveness Properties:**
   - Temporal logic verification with fairness assumptions
   - Bounded model checking for progress guarantees
   - Statistical verification for probabilistic properties

3. **Resilience Properties:**
   - Fault injection testing with Byzantine nodes
   - Network partition simulation
   - Recovery scenario verification

### Verification Infrastructure

```bash
# Automated verification script structure
verify_configuration() {
    local nodes=$1
    local byzantine_ratio=$2
    local network_condition=$3
    
    # Generate TLA+ configuration
    generate_config $nodes $byzantine_ratio $network_condition
    
    # Run TLC model checker
    tlc -config $config_file Alpenglow.tla
    
    # Analyze results
    analyze_results $nodes $byzantine_ratio $network_condition
}
```

### Performance Optimization

1. **State Constraints:**
   - Limit slot progression to reasonable bounds
   - Constrain message buffer sizes
   - Optimize state space exploration

2. **Symmetry Reduction:**
   - Use node symmetry where applicable
   - Reduce equivalent state exploration
   - Focus on representative scenarios

3. **Statistical Sampling:**
   - Monte Carlo simulation for large configurations
   - Confidence interval calculation for properties
   - Adaptive sampling based on property complexity

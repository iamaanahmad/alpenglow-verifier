# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for optimizing and finalizing the Alpenglow Formal Verification System for hackathon submission. The goal is to ensure the project is perfectly positioned to win first prize by systematically reviewing, cleaning, and enhancing all aspects of the submission to exceed judge expectations and demonstrate clear competitive superiority.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want to ensure my Alpenglow formal verification project meets the highest quality standards, so that it demonstrates technical excellence and wins first prize.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is evaluated THEN the system SHALL demonstrate 100% compliance with all hackathon requirements
2. WHEN judges review the technical implementation THEN the system SHALL show zero counterexamples across all 13 verified properties
3. WHEN the verification system is tested THEN it SHALL execute successfully with 100% pass rate
4. IF any technical issues exist THEN the system SHALL identify and resolve them before submission
5. WHEN the codebase is reviewed THEN it SHALL contain only production-quality, well-documented code

### Requirement 2: Repository Optimization

**User Story:** As a judge evaluating submissions, I want to see a clean, professional repository with clear documentation, so that I can quickly understand the project's achievements and technical merit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository is accessed THEN it SHALL present a professional, well-organized structure
2. WHEN unnecessary files are identified THEN the system SHALL remove or relocate them to maintain focus
3. WHEN documentation is reviewed THEN it SHALL be comprehensive, accurate, and judge-focused
4. IF demo files or development artifacts exist THEN they SHALL be cleaned up or moved to appropriate locations
5. WHEN the README is evaluated THEN it SHALL clearly communicate the project's achievements and competitive advantages

### Requirement 3: Competitive Positioning

**User Story:** As a hackathon winner, I want to clearly demonstrate why my project deserves first prize, so that judges can easily identify its superior technical merit and innovation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN competitive analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL identify and highlight unique achievements
2. WHEN innovation is evaluated THEN the project SHALL demonstrate breakthrough technical contributions
3. WHEN technical metrics are compared THEN the system SHALL show measurable superiority over alternatives
4. IF gaps in competitive positioning exist THEN they SHALL be addressed with additional evidence or improvements
5. WHEN judges evaluate submissions THEN this project SHALL stand out as the clear first prize winner

### Requirement 4: Verification System Validation

**User Story:** As a technical evaluator, I want to verify that all formal verification claims are accurate and reproducible, so that I can trust the mathematical guarantees provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verification scripts are executed THEN they SHALL complete successfully with 100% pass rate
2. WHEN TLA+ specifications are checked THEN they SHALL compile and verify without errors
3. WHEN properties are tested THEN all 13 SHALL be mathematically proven with zero counterexamples
4. IF any verification failures occur THEN they SHALL be investigated and resolved immediately
5. WHEN the web interface is tested THEN it SHALL build and function correctly across all pages

### Requirement 5: Presentation Excellence

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to experience an impressive, professional presentation of the project, so that I can quickly appreciate its technical achievements and innovation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web interface is accessed THEN it SHALL provide a professional, responsive user experience
2. WHEN technical documentation is reviewed THEN it SHALL be comprehensive and well-structured
3. WHEN demonstration materials are prepared THEN they SHALL effectively showcase key achievements
4. IF presentation issues exist THEN they SHALL be identified and resolved for maximum judge impact
5. WHEN the project is demonstrated THEN it SHALL clearly communicate its first-prize worthiness

### Requirement 6: Final Submission Preparation

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want to complete all final preparations for submission, so that my project is perfectly positioned to win first prize with no remaining issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN final testing is performed THEN all systems SHALL function perfectly without errors
2. WHEN submission materials are prepared THEN they SHALL be complete, professional, and compelling
3. WHEN the project is ready for submission THEN it SHALL exceed all hackathon requirements
4. IF any final issues are discovered THEN they SHALL be resolved before submission deadline
5. WHEN judges evaluate the submission THEN it SHALL demonstrate clear superiority over all competitors

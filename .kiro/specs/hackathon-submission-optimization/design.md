# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the systematic approach for optimizing the Alpenglow Formal Verification System for hackathon submission. The system is already in excellent condition with 13/13 properties verified and zero counterexamples, but requires final optimization to ensure maximum judge impact and guarantee first prize victory.

The design focuses on five key areas: project quality assurance, repository optimization, competitive positioning enhancement, verification system validation, and presentation excellence. Each area is designed to build upon the existing strong foundation while addressing any remaining gaps that could impact judge evaluation.

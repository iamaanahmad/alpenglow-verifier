# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze current project structure and create cleanup strategy





  - Scan all files and categorize by importance and hackathon relevance
  - Identify temporary files, duplicates, and unnecessary artifacts
  - Create comprehensive file classification for cleanup decisions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Clean up temporary and redundant files







  - [x] 2.1 Remove TTrace files and model checker artifacts



    - Delete all `*TTrace*.tla` and `*TTrace*.bin` files (temporary model checker outputs)
    - Clean up `.toolbox` directories and temporary verification artifacts
    - Remove any cache directories and build artifacts
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

  - [x] 2.2 Remove redundant batch files and scripts


    - Identify duplicate functionality between `.bat` and `.ps1` files
    - Keep only the most comprehensive PowerShell scripts
    - Remove redundant batch files that duplicate PowerShell functionality
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

  - [x] 2.3 Consolidate documentation files


    - Remove intermediate and draft documentation files
    - Keep only final, comprehensive documentation
    - Ensure README.md remains the primary entry point
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2_

- [ ] 3. Verify hackathon requirements compliance


  - [x] 3.1 Validate formal specification completeness


    - Confirm `Alpenglow.tla` contains all required protocol components
    - Verify Votor dual voting paths implementation
    - Check Rotor erasure-coded block propagation
    - Validate certificate generation and timeout mechanisms
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

  - [x] 3.2 Confirm all properties are verified


    - Validate all 13 properties are properly implemented in `Properties.tla`
    - Ensure safety, liveness, and resilience properties are complete
    - Verify Byzantine fault tolerance proofs are comprehensive
    - _Requirements: 3.2, 4.1, 4.2_

  - [x] 3.3 Test model checking configurations







    - Run verification on all test configurations to ensure no regressions
    - Validate exhaustive verification for small configurations (4-10 nodes)
    - Confirm statistical model checking for larger networks works
    - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.3_

- [x] 4. Optimize web interface and deployment




  - [x] 4.1 Test web interface functionality


    - Verify all 7 pages load correctly with responsive design
    - Test AI-powered features and interactive components
    - Ensure navigation and user experience are optimal
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.4_

  - [x] 4.2 Validate GitHub Pages deployment


    - Test automated deployment pipeline works correctly
    - Verify all pages deploy without errors
    - Confirm static site generation is optimized
    - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 5. Final validation and optimization
  - [ ] 5.1 Run comprehensive verification suite
    - Execute `run_full_verification.ps1` to ensure all tests pass
    - Validate 100% success rate is maintained after cleanup
    - Confirm all 13 properties still verify correctly
    - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.4_

  - [ ] 5.2 Polish primary documentation
    - Ensure README.md clearly presents achievements and setup instructions
    - Verify technical reports highlight key innovations and results
    - Confirm all links and references work correctly
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

  - [ ] 5.3 Create final submission checklist
    - Verify all hackathon deliverables are present and accessible
    - Confirm GitHub repository is properly organized and documented
    - Validate technical report demonstrates rigor and completeness
    - Ensure web interface provides engaging demonstration
    - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2_

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the Alpenglow formal verification project for hackathon submission by cleaning up unnecessary files, ensuring perfect alignment with hackathon requirements, and maximizing the chances of winning first prize. The project already has excellent technical foundations with 100% verification success rate and comprehensive documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want to clean up unnecessary files and optimize the project structure, so that judges can easily navigate and evaluate the submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify and remove all unnecessary files that don't contribute to the hackathon evaluation
2. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL ensure all core deliverables are easily accessible and well-organized
3. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL preserve all essential verification files, documentation, and web interface components
4. WHEN optimizing THEN the system SHALL maintain the 100% verification success rate and all technical achievements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to quickly understand the project's achievements and technical quality, so that I can efficiently evaluate the submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN judges access the repository THEN they SHALL immediately see a clear README with project overview and achievements
2. WHEN evaluating technical quality THEN judges SHALL find all verification results, documentation, and proof artifacts easily accessible
3. WHEN reviewing code THEN judges SHALL see clean, well-organized TLA+ specifications and verification scripts
4. WHEN testing the system THEN judges SHALL be able to reproduce all results with simple commands

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a hackathon submission, I want to perfectly align with all hackathon requirements, so that I maximize the chances of winning first prize.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing against hackathon requirements THEN the system SHALL demonstrate 100% compliance with all three key requirements
2. WHEN showcasing achievements THEN the system SHALL highlight the 13 verified properties, Byzantine fault tolerance, and performance guarantees
3. WHEN presenting deliverables THEN the system SHALL clearly show the GitHub repository, technical report, and interactive web interface
4. WHEN demonstrating innovation THEN the system SHALL emphasize the novel verification techniques and comprehensive analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a technical evaluator, I want to verify the rigor and completeness of the formal verification, so that I can assess the mathematical correctness and practical impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating rigor THEN the system SHALL demonstrate successful verification of all core Alpenglow theorems with proper formal abstraction
2. WHEN assessing completeness THEN the system SHALL show comprehensive coverage including edge cases, Byzantine scenarios, and boundary conditions
3. WHEN reviewing methodology THEN the system SHALL present clear documentation of verification approaches and optimization techniques
4. WHEN validating results THEN the system SHALL provide reproducible verification with automated scripts and clear instructions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to ensure the web interface and deployment are production-ready, so that the interactive demonstration works flawlessly for judges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN all 7 pages SHALL load correctly with responsive design and AI-powered features
2. WHEN deploying to GitHub Pages THEN the automated deployment SHALL work without errors
3. WHEN testing functionality THEN all interactive features SHALL work including verification monitoring and analysis tools
4. WHEN demonstrating the system THEN the web interface SHALL provide an engaging and informative user experience

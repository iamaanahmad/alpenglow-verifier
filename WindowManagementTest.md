# Window Management System Implementation Test

## Requirements Verification

### Requirement 5.1: Slot window boundaries and window state variables
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Added `windows`, `window_bounds`, and `current_window` state variables
- Implemented `WindowForSlot(sl)` function to calculate window for any slot
- Added `WindowBounds(w)` function to get start/end boundaries for windows
- Added `SlotsInWindow(w)` function to get all slots in a window

### Requirement 5.2: Window-based consensus logic and window transition handling  
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Added `AdvanceWindow` action to transition between windows
- Implemented `WindowBasedConsensusLogic` invariant to ensure consensus respects windows
- Added window awareness to finalization with `WindowAwareFinalizeBlock` action
- Updated `RotateLeader` and `TimeoutSkip` to handle window transitions

### Requirement 5.3: Bounded finalization times within windows
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Added `WindowFinalizationBound(w)` function to calculate maximum finalization time
- Implemented `WindowFinalizationIsBounded(w)` check for bounded finalization
- Added finalization time constraints based on window size and slot timeout

### Requirement 5.4: State consistency across window transitions
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Added `WindowStateConsistency` invariant to ensure proper window state
- Implemented `WindowTransitionConsistency` to verify previous windows are complete
- Added `FinalizationRespectsWindowConstraints` to ensure ordered finalization
- Created comprehensive `WindowManagementInvariants` combining all window checks

## Implementation Details

### State Variables Added:
- `windows`: Set of active windows
- `window_bounds`: Function mapping windows to their boundaries  
- `current_window`: Current active window number

### Helper Functions Added:
- `WindowForSlot(sl)`: Calculate which window a slot belongs to
- `WindowBounds(w)`: Get start/end boundaries for a window
- `SlotInWindow(sl, w)`: Check if slot is in specific window
- `SlotsInWindow(w)`: Get all slots in a window
- `WindowIsActive(w)`: Check if window is active
- `WindowIsComplete(w)`: Check if all slots in window are processed
- `FinalizedSlotsInWindow(w)`: Get finalized slots in window
- `TimedOutSlotsInWindow(w)`: Get timed out slots in window

### Actions Added:
- `AdvanceWindow`: Transition to next window when appropriate
- `CompleteWindow(w)`: Mark window as complete
- `WindowAwareFinalizeBlock(b, sl)`: Window-aware finalization

### Invariants Added:
- `WindowStateConsistency`: Ensure proper window state management
- `WindowTransitionConsistency`: Verify window transitions are valid
- `WindowBasedConsensusLogic`: Ensure consensus respects window boundaries
- `FinalizationRespectsWindowConstraints`: Ensure ordered finalization within windows
- `WindowManagementInvariants`: Combined window management checks

### Configuration Updates:
- Added `WindowSize` constant to all configuration files
- Created `MC_Window_Test.cfg` for dedicated window management testing
- Updated existing test configurations with window parameters

## Test Configuration
The window management system can be tested using:
- `MC_Window_Test.cfg`: Dedicated window management testing with 8 slots, window size 4
- Updated existing configurations now include window management invariants

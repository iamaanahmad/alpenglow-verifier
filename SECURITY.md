# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

The Enhanced Alpenglow Formal Verification project is committed to maintaining the highest security standards. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## 🛡️ What We Secure

### Formal Verification Integrity
- **Mathematical Correctness**: All proofs are machine-checkable
- **Property Completeness**: Comprehensive coverage of security properties
- **Byzantine Fault Modeling**: Realistic attack scenarios
- **Verification Reproducibility**: Consistent results across environments

### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates
- **Access Controls**: Proper authentication and authorization
- **Data Protection**: Secure handling of sensitive information

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure
We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please:

1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO** email security reports to: [security@your-domain.com]
3. **DO** provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **DO** allow reasonable time for us to respond and fix the issue

### What to Include
- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** assessment
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information**

### Response Timeline
- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment
- **7 days**: Detailed response with timeline
- **30 days**: Fix implementation (for critical issues)

## 🔍 Security Considerations

### Formal Verification Security
